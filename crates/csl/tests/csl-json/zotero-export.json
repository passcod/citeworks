		"abstract": "Complex optical devices including aspherical focusing mirrors, solar concentrator arrays, and immersion lenses were 3D printed using commercial technology and experimentally demonstrated by evaluating surface roughness and shape. The as-printed surfaces had surface roughness on the order of tens of microns. To improve this unacceptable surface quality for creating optics, a polymer smoothing technique was developed. Atomic force microscopy and optical profilometry showed that the smoothing technique reduced the surface roughness to a few nanometers, consistent with the requirements of high-quality optics, while tests of optical functionality demonstrated that the overall shapes were maintained so that near theoretically predicted operation was achieved. The optical surface smoothing technique is a promising approach towards using 3D printing as a flexible tool for prototyping and fabrication of miniaturized high-quality optics.",
