  abstract: Complex optical devices including aspherical focusing mirrors, solar concentrator
    arrays, and immersion lenses were 3D printed using commercial technology and experimentally
    demonstrated by evaluating surface roughness and shape. The as-printed surfaces
    had surface roughness on the order of tens of microns. To improve this unacceptable
    surface quality for creating optics, a polymer smoothing technique was developed.
    Atomic force microscopy and optical profilometry showed that the smoothing technique
    reduced the surface roughness to a few nanometers, consistent with the requirements
    of high-quality optics, while tests of optical functionality demonstrated that
    the overall shapes were maintained so that near theoretically predicted operation
    was achieved. The optical surface smoothing technique is a promising approach
    towards using 3D printing as a flexible tool for prototyping and fabrication of
    miniaturized high-quality optics.
